Jaguars are excellent swimmers and climbers. They are often seen swimming in rivers and lakes, and they can climb trees to catch prey or to escape danger.
Jaguars have a very strong bite. They have the strongest bite force of any big cat, relative to their size. This allows them to kill their prey with a single bite to the neck.
Jaguars are solitary animals, but they are also very social when it comes to their cubs. Mothers will stay with their cubs for up to two years, teaching them how to hunt and survive.
Jaguars are very important to the rainforest ecosystem. They help to control populations of prey animals, and they also help to disperse seeds.
